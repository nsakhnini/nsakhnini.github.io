**Summary.**
We built a website to estimate pollution exposure during travels and outdoor time. Our tool imports pollution levels from the Array of Things (AoT) which a Chicago-based project to measure air pollution locally using high-end stations placed across the city. The website shows the current pollution levels read by the closest AoT node as well as current weather condition. The map shows current readings of nearby stations.
