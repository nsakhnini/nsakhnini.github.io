**Abstract.**
The kind of technology (tech) support that older adults prefer during continued mobile use varies widely. So does the perceived quality of that support. However, we know little about what influences these preferences and perceptions. We conducted an online survey with 138 U.S. older adults to understand how mobile device proficiency and feelings of anxiety and confidence during mobile use impact the preference for and perception of mobile tech support in older adults. Proficiency predicted a positive preference for self-reliant support but a negative preference for social support during continued mobile tech use. The effects of proficiency and confidence on the perceived quality of self-reliant mobile tech support in older adults were partially mediated by a preference for it.
