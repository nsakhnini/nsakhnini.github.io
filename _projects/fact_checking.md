**Abstract.**
Falsehoods continue to spread faster than facts in todayâ€™s age of continuous, digital connections. Recent studies show older adults engage more frequently with misinformation than younger users. Given the reported uptake of mobile technologies among older adults (61% of US adults over 65 owned a smartphone in 2021), much of these engagements may occur via smartphones or tablets. What types of fact-checkers are currently available on smartphones? How do older adults fact-check information they encounter in their daily lives? In this paper, we explore these questions with a systematic app review and a semi-structured interview with older adults. Among the 8372 unique smartphone fact-checking apps identified, 45 apps were qualitatively and systematically reviewed. Five distinct user interface (UI) elements emerged: news feed, article view, fact-checking widget, learning tool, and search view. An interactive fact-checking option was found in 73% of the apps. None of our older interviewees reported using a smartphone fact-checking app but described other fact-checking behaviors, such as asking friends or acquaintances with domain expertise or searching on Google.
